    <h1>Welcome to GraphSketcher 2</h1>
    <p>
        GraphSketcher is a simple, elegant tool for quickly sketching graphs and plotting data — but you don’t even need data to get started. It’s <span class="yellow">perfect for reports, presentations, and problem sets</span> where you need to produce sharp-looking graphs on the fly.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li class="fix">Fixed a bug where tab-delimited data was not parsed correctly on paste.</li>
    </ul>
